A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Supply Chain Demand Forecasting.

## Overview

DemandCraft is an AI-powered demand forecasting intelligence system that helps supply chain companies automate the complex and time-consuming process of creating accurate demand predictions across multiple time horizons. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps Chief Revenue Officers, VP of Demand Planning, and supply chain directors reduce excess inventory, minimize stockouts, optimize promotional campaigns, and improve forecast accuracy through real-time analysis of demand planning, sales, and market intelligence data.

The application utilizes a synthetic supply chain dataset that simulates data from demand planning systems, point-of-sale terminals, customer relationship management platforms, and market intelligence databases. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for supply chain demand forecasting analytics.

## Data Sources

The application is designed to work with data from major supply chain and demand planning systems:

### Supply Chain Data Sources (Simulated)
- **Demand Planning Systems**: 
  - Oracle Demantra
  - SAP Integrated Business Planning
  - Kinaxis RapidResponse
- **Point of Sale (POS) Systems**: 
  - NCR
  - Diebold Nixdorf
  - Toshiba Commerce Solutions
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: 
  - Salesforce
  - Microsoft Dynamics CRM
  - HubSpot
- **Market Intelligence Platforms**: 
  - Nielsen
  - IRI
  - Euromonitor International
- **Economic Data Sources**: 
  - Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
  - Bloomberg Terminal
  - Refinitiv Eikon

For demonstration and development purposes, we've created a synthetic dataset that approximates these data sources and combined them into a single table exposed through an API server. This approach allows for realistic supply chain demand forecasting analytics without using proprietary demand planning data.

## Key Features

## Setup Instructions

1. Within Snowflake, click on **Projects**
2. Click on **Streamlit**
3. Click the blue box in the upper right to create a new Streamlit application
4. On the next page:
   - Name your application
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the database context
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the schema context

### Fivetran Data Movement Setup

1. Ensure the API server hosting the synthetic supply chain data is operational
2. Configure the custom Fivetran connector (built with Fivetran Connector SDK) to connect to the API server - debug and deploy
3. Start the Fivetran sync in the Fivetran UI to move data into a `SPL_RECORDS` table in your Snowflake instance
4. Verify data is being loaded correctly by checking the table in Snowflake

## Data Flow

1. **Synthetic Data Creation**: A synthetic dataset approximating real supply chain demand forecasting data sources has been created and exposed via an API server:
   - Demand Planning Systems: Oracle Demantra, SAP Integrated Business Planning, Kinaxis RapidResponse
   - Point of Sale Systems: NCR, Diebold Nixdorf, Toshiba Commerce Solutions
   - Market Intelligence: Nielsen, IRI, Euromonitor International

2. **Custom Data Integration**: A custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK communicates with the API server to extract the synthetic supply chain demand forecasting data

3. **Automated Data Movement**: Fivetran manages the orchestration and scheduling of data movement from the API server into Snowflake

4. **Data Loading**: The synthetic supply chain data is loaded into Snowflake as a `SPL_RECORDS` table in a structured format ready for analysis

5. **Data Analysis**: Snowpark for Python and Snowflake Cortex analyze the data to generate insights

6. **Data Visualization**: Streamlit in Snowflake presents the analyzed data in an interactive data application

## Data Requirements

The application expects a table named `SPL_RECORDS` which contains synthetic data simulating various supply chain demand forecasting systems. This data is retrieved from an API server using a custom Fivetran connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK:

### Demand Forecasting Identifiers

- `PRODUCT_SKU`
- `LOCATION_CODE`

### Forecast Information
- `FORECAST_DATE`
- `FORECAST_HORIZON_DAYS`
- `BASELINE_DEMAND_FORECAST`
- `ADJUSTED_DEMAND_FORECAST`
- `ACTUAL_SALES_UNITS`

### Inventory and Sales Data
