### Introduction (3 minutes)

**[Slide: DemandCraft Supply Chain Overview]**

"Thank you all for joining today. I'm [Name] from Fivetran, and I'm excited to show you a prototype solution that demonstrates how AI-driven approaches could potentially transform supply chain demand forecasting and inventory optimization. As supply chain leaders, you understand the mounting pressure from inventory optimization challenges, demand volatility, and the need to balance forecast accuracy with operational efficiency.

Today's supply chain organizations are facing unprecedented challenges:

- Traditional demand forecasting methods achieving only 60-70% accuracy
- $1.1 trillion in excess inventory globally creating significant carrying costs
- Frequent stockouts damaging customer relationships and revenue
- Manual demand planning processes consuming significant operational resources
- Difficulty incorporating external market signals into accurate predictions

Industry research indicates:

- Companies struggle to integrate economic indicators, social trends, and competitor actions into forecasting
- Promotional impact modeling often lacks ROI optimization capabilities
- New product launch demand prediction remains highly challenging
- Legacy statistical models struggle with emerging market patterns

DemandCraft is a prototype that demonstrates how bringing together data from demand planning systems, POS platforms, CRM systems, and market intelligence – integrated through Fivetran – and applying AI Agent Workflows could potentially automate demand forecasting insights and optimize supply chain operations.

In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you this proof-of-concept and discuss how such an approach might help address challenges in forecast accuracy improvement, excess inventory reduction, and overall supply chain efficiency."

### Business Challenge Context (2 minutes)

**[Slide: The Supply Chain Demand Planning Challenge]**

"The challenge most supply chain organizations face isn't a lack of data – it's that critical demand intelligence is often trapped in disconnected systems:

- Demand planning data in systems like Oracle Demantra, SAP IBP, and Kinaxis RapidResponse
- Point of sale insights in platforms like NCR, Diebold Nixdorf, and Toshiba Commerce Solutions
- Customer behavior data in CRM systems like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and HubSpot
- Market intelligence in systems like Nielsen, IRI, and Euromonitor International
- Economic indicators from Federal Reserve Economic Data, Bloomberg Terminal, and Refinitiv Eikon

When demand patterns shift or market conditions change, the correlation between these data sources may not be immediately obvious without connecting all these pieces. Demand planning teams often lack the time to manually analyze this data across thousands of product SKUs and multiple geographic locations.

DemandCraft demonstrates how automatically integrating data from these sources through Fivetran's supply chain connectors and applying AI Agent Workflows could potentially reveal actionable insights that teams might use for both demand optimization and inventory management."
